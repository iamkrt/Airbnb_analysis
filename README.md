# PROBLEM STATEMENT

We are looking at New York City Airbnb listings (2011-2019) to answer the question: Which Neighborhood group is the best to invest in? 

Investing requires seeing where costs (prices) are low, and revenues are growing. We have to look at the data from multiple dimensions to get a sense of where the growth is happening to have confidence when choosing where we will get the best bang for our buck.

This includes looking at prices, number of reviews, revenue (which we estimate) and geographical distribution to name a few dimensions.






# KEY TAKEAWAYS

● Renting out a property on Airbnb has become a popular way for people to generate extra income.

● As with all real estate, the main driver of profits will be location.

● But, for an Airbnb, location doesn't just mean high demand from
renters—it also means affordable housing since high costs can quickly eat into profits.<img width="1221" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-05 at 11 25 41 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42109704/177363021-24aaaf35-f98e-4842-a6dc-ec4b892296ea.png">


## Key Profit Factors for Airbnb Renting

As with all things real estate, it’s location. Some American cities are able to generate hefty profits for those who list on the site. In other places, the quest for rental income has proven a little more elusive. A number of factors account for those disparities.
If the city has a relatively small supply of hotel rooms, for example, that tends to drive up Airbnb prices. But where hotels are plentiful and affordable, investors have little choice but to keep their rates low. The cost of housing is another big part of the equation. Places where investors can rent or buy for relatively little—but see a steady demand from tourists—represent the real sweet spot.


## Host Profit

The host profit in the last quarter of the recent years is always falling, despite vacation time.Some of the reasons:

● Safety

Airbnb has dealt with a string of safety issues, everything from racism to prostitution to gun violence in recent years.
This may have led to a decline in some of the profits.


 ● Tech and administrative costs
Airbnb doesn’t own the properties on its platform. What makes Airbnb valuable is the platform itself: It provides an easy way for home owners to connect with renters around the world.


## Real Estate Value and User and Host Attractiveness

The Pareto Charts indicate that most of the profit comes from a few neighborhoods.

Some of the most attractive neighborhoods include East Village, West Village, Fort Greene.


## Neighborhood and Prices

Based on clustering it is clear that Private room and Entire home receive maximum number of reviews. This means people do not prefer shared rooms as compared to private and entire homes.
This also justifies that most of the profit is generated by private rooms and Entire homes.<img width="1063" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-05 at 11 30 50 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42109704/177364027-60576eeb-8c82-4286-bd37-f3ce4a3b10af.png">


## Most Popular Areas

Maximum Airbnb properties are in the area of Brooklyn and Manhattan.

The most popular areas in NYC where there are maximum airbnb properties are:

● Williamsburg in Brooklyn

● Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn

● Harlem in Manhattan

● Bushwick in Brooklyn

● Upper east side in Manhattan

# Reviews vs Profit Insights

The average number no. of reviews shows an increase over years, however, shows a sharp shoot up in 2019. Despite an increase in avg no. of reviews, the host profit ratio shows a decline in 2019.

Long Island is the most popular neighbourhood, Astoria is the close second<img width="894" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-05 at 11 32 51 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42109704/177364378-3957d4e6-c94b-43df-a261-b26abc27c1b5.png">


The number of reviews is mainly mostly focused lower than 1000, with a host profit ratio in the range of 500k.

Even when the number of reviews is high the host profit ratio is concentrated in the lower range, with no mentionable effect.

The shared room has the lowest profit ratio, all room types are moderately positively correlated in terms of the number of reviews and hostprofit.

Only Brooklyn has a cluster that has a negative correlation between the number of reviews and host profit, reviews are ranging mostly from 600 to 1300, however, host profit shows a decline, which is attributed to shared rooms upon the entire home/apartment.



# RECOMMENDATIONS

It looks like investing in Long Island is the safest bet. It is seeing steady growth in prices and revenues, and user value metrics are rising as well. 

However, that is all predicated on the quality of the data, which has been shown to have issues when using features such as revenue, and the various desirability KPIs.

### High Priority Recommendation

- improve data quality by studying revenue, profitability and other user KPI metrics to ensure they are accurate and precise
- develop further metrics for understanding how number of ratings can be predicted

### Low Priority Recommendation

- Invest in the Queens neighborhood group
- Further investigate the Astoria neighborhood within the Queens group
